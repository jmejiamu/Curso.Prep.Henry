Object: It is a collection of data made of keys and values called properties.
Properties: it is collection of values in the object such as string, booleans, ints and floats.
Method: This can hold different operation within the object and it can have access to any properties in the object.

Dot notation vs bracket notation: Both are ways of accessing  properties in a object the implementation is different.
for example Dot notation: objectName.propertyName and bracket notation: objectName[propertyName]
